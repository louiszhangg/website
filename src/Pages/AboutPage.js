                <br></br>
                <p className="text">I am a recent computer science graduate from Virginia Tech. My passion for coding started at the age of 13, driven by its ability to bring any idea to life.</p>

                <p className="text">I believe computer science is far from boring. Things like web development, for instance, can stir hearts and minds, inspiring creativity and innovations in others.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="text">Outside of tech, I express my creativity through photography and music, and I find inspiration by travelling and hiking. I'm also passionate about advocating for more livable and sustainable cities.</p>
                <br></br>
                <p className="text">I aspire to work as a software engineer, creating products that enhance lives and spark inspiration.</p>
